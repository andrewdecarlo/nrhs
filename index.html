                <p>The New River Humane Society (NRHS) is a passionate group that is dedicated to serving the needs of community members and animals in Fayette County, WV and beyond. The Fayette County Animal Control Center is operated and managed by the NRHS. Animals housed at the New River Humane Society/Fayette County Animal Control Center are strays, abandoned, neglected or abused, and surrendered by their owners. It is important that the animals get adopted or go to rescue groups because there is never a shortage of those in need of a forever home, so we try to keep room for more homeless pets coming in. Strays (pets brought to us that were running loose) are held for seven days, and then made available for adoption. Surrendered pets (those brought to us by the owner) are available for adoption immediately. While they are here, they receive their first vaccinations (Distemper, Parvo, Bordetella), are de-wormed, and provided medical care when necessary.</p>
                <p>We are happy for our dogs that get to participate in the <a href=https://www.paws4people.org/paws4prisons/ target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">paws4prisons program</a> at Mt. Olive Correctional Center. As of winter 2014, five of our dogs have completed the program and are successfully adopted into forever homes! Four others dogs are in the program now. The dogs are vetted prior to entering the program (spayed/neutered, vaccinated, de-wormed). In the program they are trained to obey commands, to leash walk, and then they have the potential to graduate into other programs. Donations are accepted for the continuation of this program.</p>
                <p>We are unable to manage or house wildlife. For problems with wildlife, please contact the <a href="http://www.wvdnr.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">West Virginia Division of Natural Resources</a>, Lt. Colonel Jerry Jenkins at <a href="tel:304-558-2784">304-558-2784</a>.</p>
