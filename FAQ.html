                <h3>I'm ready to adopt a pet. What do I need to do?</h3>
                    <p class="FAQ">Drop by the shelter during our open hours and take a look around (Tuesday - Saturday, 11 am - 5 pm, 513 Shelter Rd, Fayetteville). Bring a valid driver’s license or state ID, local check or cash. Some of our adoptable pets have photos here: petfinder.com/shelters/WV47 but many more pets are available at the shelter. Of course you may call for information and directions (304-574-3682). We are happy to help you find a cheerful addition to your family and home!<br/><br/>

                        We will tell you as much as we can about each animal in our shelter… where they came from, how they came to us, their age, breed and description, and what we’ve learned about their personalities while getting to know them.<br/><br/> 
                        
                        While they are here, they receive their first vaccinations (Distemper, Parvo, Bordetella), are de-wormed, and provided medical care when necessary. We will advise you on scheduling your new pets spay/neuter appointment (covered in the adoption fee and required by law). Every pet adopted gets a spay/neuter voucher and choice of veterinarian (from five options).<br/><br/>
                        
                        Don’t forget your driver's license or state issued ID.  We only accept cash or check. There are absolutely no refunds.</p>
            
                <h3>What is the adoption fee?</h3>
                    <p class="FAQ">$85 for dogs/puppies and $65 for cats/kittens As of July 1, 2016 <br/><br/>
                        Adoption fees help cover the cost of spay/neuter for adopted pets, and they make it possible for us to continue our efforts rescuing, caring for, and finding forever homes for forgotten, abused, and unwanted animals.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Free pets (not from the shelter) usually haven’t received any medical care, so while you may initially save on an adoption fee, the medical costs will add up quickly. The vaccines can cost $62, de-worming can cost more than $24 depending on the size of the animal, up to $125 to spay a dog, up to $80 to spay a cat, up to $85 to neuter a dog, and up to $50 to neuter a cat!<br/><br/>
                        
                        Our adoption fee ($85 for canines and $65 for felines) includes their first vaccinations (Distemper, Parvo, Bordetella), de-worming, medical care, and spay/neuter (required by law).<br/><br/>
                        
                        Vaccines, medical care, food and transportation while the pet waits with us for a forever home are provided by the New River Humane Society. The Fayette County Animal Control Center and donations to the New River Humane Society also help to provide care for animals in the shelter who may have medical bills that are much higher than any possible adoption fee.<br/><br/>
                        
                        You must have a valid driver's license or state issued ID, and cash or local check. There are absolutely no refunds.

                <h3>I've lost/found a pet. What should I do?</h3>
                    <p class="FAQ">
                        <u>Lost</u>:<br/><br/>Check with the New River Humane Society, Tuesday - Saturday, 11 am - 5 pm, 304-574-3682, located at 513 Shelter Rd, Fayetteville. Don’t take a chance with just a call – you must visit in person to see if your missing pet is there. Start looking as soon as you know your pet is gone and continue to check over the next couple months. Sometimes it takes a lost pet that long to make it to the shelter (lost pets may roam, evade capture, or sometimes goodhearted people take care of your pet temporarily). Strays are held for seven days, then put up for adoption. Check in with veterinarian offices, websites such as petfinder.com, and social media.<br/><br/>
                        <u>Found</u>:<br/><br/>Check his/her collar for contact information and have the stray scanned for a microchip at your vet; this quick ID check could help you find the owner right away. If none is found, contact us right away (304-574-3682, Tuesday - Saturday, 11 am - 5 pm) to let us know that you have a stray and provide a description and found location in case the owner contacts us, and to find out if we have space immediately available for the stray.
                        If you take the stray home, make sure you can keep your resident pets separate; the found stray could be sick, fearful, or aggressive with your pets. Once you have him/her safely at your home, take pictures and create a “found pet” flyer to post around the area in which the animal was found, at veterinarian offices, on websites such as petfinder.com, and social media.

                    <h3>Can I surrender my pet to the shelter?</h3>
                        <p>
                            It is a sad and difficult decision and we’re here to work together to ensure the best possible solution for you and your pet. There may be alternative rehoming options available to you dependent upon the reason you feel you need to give up your pet. Animals may be brought to the shelter if space is available. Contact us at 304-574-3682, Tuesday - Saturday, 11 am - 5 pm. Please bring a copy of your pet’s veterinary records with you.
